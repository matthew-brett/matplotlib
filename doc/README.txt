maptlotlib documentation
========================


Building the documentation
--------------------------

Dependencies:

* sphinx > 1.0
* numpydoc
* ipython
* mock
* colorspacious

All of these dependencies can be installed through pip::

  pip install sphinx numpydoc ipython mock colorspacious

or conda::

  conda install sphinx numpydoc ipython mock colorspacious

To build the HTML documentation, type ``python make.py html`` in this
directory. The top file of the results will be ./build/html/index.html

**Note that Sphinx uses the installed version of the package to build the
documentation**: matplotlib must be installed *before* the docs can be
generated. Even if that is the case, one of the files needed to do this,
'../lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc', is not version controlled, but
created when matplotlib is built. This means that the documentation cannot be
generated immediately after checking out the source code, even if matplotlib
is installed on your system: you will have to run ``python setup.py build``
first.

To build a smaller version of the documentation (without
high-resolution PNGs and PDF examples), type "python make.py --small
html".

Organization
-------------

This is the top level build directory for the matplotlib
documentation.  All of the documentation is written using sphinx, a
python documentation system built on top of ReST.  This directory contains

* users - the user documentation, e.g., plotting tutorials, configuration
  tips, etc.

* devel - documentation for matplotlib developers

* faq - frequently asked questions

* api - placeholders to automatically generate the api documentation

* mpl_toolkits - documentation of individual toolkits that ship with
  matplotlib

* make.py - the build script to build the html or PDF docs

* index.rst - the top level include document for matplotlib docs

* conf.py - the sphinx configuration

* _static - used by the sphinx build system

* _templates - used by the sphinx build system

* sphinxext - Sphinx extensions for the mpl docs

* mpl_examples - a link to the matplotlib examples in case any
  documentation wants to literal include them
