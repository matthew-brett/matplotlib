Building mpl on OSX has proven to be a nightmare because of all the
different types of zlib, png and freetype that may be on your system.

The make.osx file in this directory can help in building binary installers.

This Makefile requires you to set a PREFIX environment variable where you want
the install to go.  It will fetch the dependencies from a remote server and
install them into your PREFIX dir, and then build mpl against them.  It should
ignore any lib, png or freetype on your system

Example usage::

  make -f make.osx PREFIX=/Users/jdhunter/dev PYVERSION=2.6 \
    fetch deps mpl_install_std

Variables:
    PREFIX (required): where to install the dependencies
    PYVERSION (optional): which python version to use
       (default=python, e.g. PYVERSION=2.6 uses python2.6)

Targets:

  clean: remove compiled files
  fetch: download dependencies
  deps: build all dependencies (zlib, png, freetype)
  mpl_build: compile matplotlib
  mpl_install: install matplotlib in $PREFIX/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  mpl_install_std: install matplotlib in standard site-packages directory
  mpl_install_egg: install matplotlib as an egg
  mpl_install_develop: set up egg link to working directory (for developers)
  binaries: create the dmg file for distribution
